# cpp-Coding

This repo is for the purposes of storing C++ code ( and C code whenever required ) in order  
to teach the user about C++. 

It is assumed that you already have some knowledge on syntaxes and how to write code, compile and execute.  
So, please don't just assume that this is the whole guide.  
These are codes to help you understand what goes where.  

That being said, enjoy looking through these files whether ur a beginner or a pro coder! :)
